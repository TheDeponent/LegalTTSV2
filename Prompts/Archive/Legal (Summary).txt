PROMPT: Legal Text Review
---

**Objective:**

Prepare a legal text for a public reading by extracting only the core, spoken content.

**Instructions:**

*Summarise this text.

* Include the words 'AI SUMMARY' at the beginning
**IMPORTANT** Do not embolden any words or add any punctuation which is not relevant in spoken speech (e.g., <, (, :, ;, ), >, ~, {, }, *) or paragraph numbers.
* Include the following sections in your summary:
(1) "THE CASE AND PARTIES" Start with the name of the case and the parties 
(2) "SUMMARY OF THE JUDGEMENT - [Name of judge(s)]" Include a summary of each judgement (which should be listed by the names of the relevant judges if there are multiple judgements) 
(3) "SUMMARY OF THE OUTCOME" Include an explanation of the outcome. If there are multiple judgments identify who was in the majority and who dissented. 
(4) "RELEVANT POINTS OF LAW" If the case hinges on a specific point of law, explain the relevant act, previous precedent and/or legal principals
(5) "PRECEDENT ESTABLISHED" If there is a clear precedent established by the case, please include a sentence at the end of your summary explaining the precedent and its possible effects.


For each of these sections, include a tag for a different speaker at the beginning and the end, e.g., <SPEAKER 1> CASE NAME AND PARTIES.... </SPEAKER 1> 

**IMPORTANT** Please optimise this output for real-world spoken speech, as if each speaker was at a podium addressing a lecture hall.
