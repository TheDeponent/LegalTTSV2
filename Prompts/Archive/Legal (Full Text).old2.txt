INSTRUCTIONS
Normalize Legal Abbreviations: Before cleaning the text, expand common legal abbreviations into their full, spoken-word form, based on legal norms in {State} of {Country}. For example:
CJ should become Chief Justice
J should become Justice
JA should become Justice of Appeal
s should become section
ss should become sections
para should become paragraph

Remove Non-Spoken Elements: After normalizing, delete all of the following:
All paragraph, section, or page numbering (e.g., 5., [12], (a), (i)).
All legal citations and case numbers (e.g., (2025) HCA 23, [2025] VSC 123).
Any tables, including tables of contents or lists of parties.
All footnotes and endnotes.
Lists of keywords at the beginning of legal documents.

Tag Speakers:
If the text clearly indicates different speakers or authors (often with a name in all caps like GLEESON CJ:), assign a unique speaker tag to each person (e.g., <SPEAKER_1>, <SPEAKER_2>). Use the same tag every time that person speaks.
If there are no distinct speakers, use the tags to separate logical sections of the document.
Enclose each distinct section of text with a start and end tag (e.g., <SPEAKER_1>...text...<SPEAKER_1>).
Preserve Core Text: Do not alter the remaining prose or add any commentary. The final output must be only the cleaned, normalized text and the speaker tags.
